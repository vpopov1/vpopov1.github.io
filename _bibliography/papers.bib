  abstract={Laparoscopic surgeries require a high degree of visuo-spatial coordination between attending and resident surgeons. The challenge is intensifed when surgeons communicate verbally using visual cues. Most prior work in the space supports attending surgeons to give clearer instructions to residents. However, in order to achieve intraoperative success, shared understanding, coordination and trust between faculty-resident dyads is essential. Our work focuses on unpacking both attending and resident surgeons’ experiences during intraoperative operations. We perform an interview study with 6 attending and 3 resident surgeons, in which we ask participants to share their thoughts on the utility and feasibility of capturing surgical dyads’ joint visual attention (JVA) during live surgeries. We fnd that attending and resident surgeons have contrasting and complementary views about autonomy, communication and coordination during surgeries. We also see positive attitudes towards capturing surgeons’ visual attention during live surgeries and using the data to support communication, coordination and instruction.},

  author={Salavitabar, Arash and Popov, Vitaliy and Nelson, Jeremy and Benedict, Michelle D and Inniss, Donovan A and Mahajan, Arushi P and Cohen, Mark S and Owens, Sonal T},
  abstract={While bedside training has always presented its own unique challenges, the COVID-19 pandemic era has intensified barriers to suitable provider and trainee experiences for both patient care and medical education. This project introduced an innovative solution with the Extended Reality International Grand Rounds, a collaboration between the University of Michigan Center for Medical and Surgical Extended Reality and Imperial College London. Three complex cases were presented to trainees through a wireless, extended reality (XR) headset and augmented by holographic visual aids and expert commentary. This pilot rounding experience was performed through the first-person view of one clinician at the bedside. In 2020, 140 attendees participated in XR International Grand Rounds, and 82 (59%) and 61 (44%) completed pre- and post surveys, respectively. Survey analysis showed that the majority of respondents (65, 79.3%) had very little to no baseline experience with XR technologies and nearly all (75, 91.5%) agreed that the development and implementation of XR curricula are important in medical training, indicating an unmet need. Nearly all respondents (59, 96.7%) found value in the ability to visualize patients’ clinical findings in the XR rounding experience and 60 (98.4%) found value in the ability to visualize patient-specific imaging and test findings in an XR format. Limiting exposure to high-risk patients and care team members with this innovative format was believed to be important to 79 (96.3%) respondents at baseline and that perception was unchanged following the event. This solution to a long-standing dilemma, newly stressed by a unique era in medicine, was a successful collaboration using state-of-the-art XR technology. Next steps will include introducing more advanced physical exam visualization and detection and comprehensive evaluation of the patient experience, as well as expanding the international experience in a format that is scalable to other interested institutions.},

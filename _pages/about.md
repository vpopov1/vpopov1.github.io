I am an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Learning Health Sciences](https://medicine.umich.edu/dept/learning-health-sciences) with a courtesy appointment at the [U-M School of Information](https://www.si.umich.edu/people/vitaliy-popov). 

My research focuses on understanding how team function can be optimized to lead to better learning gains, performance and healthcare outcomes. My background allows me to utilize evidence in education science, simulation-based training and learning analytics to understand how healthcare professionals can better work in teams and how we can support these processes to foster health care delivery.

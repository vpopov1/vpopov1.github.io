I am an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Learning Health Sciences](https://medicine.umich.edu/dept/learning-health-sciences) with a courtesy appointment at the [U-M School of Information](https://www.si.umich.edu/people/vitaliy-popov). I am also the Director of Learning Sciences and Technology for the [Clinical Simulation Center](https://medicine.umich.edu/dept/clinical-simulation-center) for University of Michigan Medical School. 

My research focuses on understanding how team function can be optimized to lead to better learning gains, performance and healthcare outcomes. My background allows me to utilize evidence in education science, simulation-based training and learning analytics to understand how healthcare professionals can better work in teams and how we can support these processes to foster health care delivery. I completed my Ph.D. on computer-supported collaborative learning at Wageningen University & Research Center, in the Netherlands.

Current research projects are situated at the intersection of Learning Sciences, Health Sciences, Artificial Intelligence, and eXtended Reality. I am currently serving as a PI or Co-PI on several projects funded by the National Science Foundation ranging from applying multimodal learning analytics in teamwork in VR to understanding the mechanisms of joint visual attention in the operating room. I am on the Editorial Boards for the [Annals of Medicine Journal - Medical Education section](https://www.tandfonline.com/journals/iann20/sections/medical-education) and the [International Journal of Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning](https://link.springer.com/journal/11412).

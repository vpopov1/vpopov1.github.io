<b>Overview:</b>

This novel VR simulation places a team of four participants in an in-hospital rapid-response style scenario wherein they arrive at the side of a critically ill patient, receive a care report from a bedside nurse, and must collaboratively provide life-saving care during a ~15-minute medical scenario (see short [Demo Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MjvD4-dS1CI). This project, funded by the National Science Foundation (#2202451), aims to develop and evaluate a novel debriefing system that aims to provide data-informed feedback focused on improving team-based care of patients who suffer sudden medical emergencies.

<b>Overview:</b>

Dr. Popov’s lab is seeking a highly motivated, talented computer sciences or data science student with experience in Human-Computer Interaction, Artificial Intelligence, and Learning Analytics to join a dynamic research team with expertise in learning sciences, medical education, and computer science. This position involves developing and evaluate a novel debriefing system that aims to capture and visualize multimodal data streams from the Standardized Patient simulation environment to evaluate learners’ communication skills. Through this new multimodal debriefing system, instructors will be able to provide new insights and personalized feedback to medical students during post-simulation debriefing sessions to allow for more meaningful reflection, targeted intervention, and rapid development of these complex skills. 

The successful candidate will help engineer and evolve an unobtrusive multi-modal sensor-based data collection system. The candidate will also contribute to writing research papers and technical reports based on his/her work.

<b>Qualification requirements</b>

Applicants must hold a PhD degree or equivalent in computer science, statistics, learning science, or another field with relevance to higher education research (e.g., learning analytics, human factors, social or behavioral sciences). 
The successful applicant should have a strong background in some or all of the following subjects, or a related discipline: 
•	social signal processing
•	machine learning
•	affective computing 
•	strong programming skills in at least one relevant language (e.g. C/C++, Java, Python, R, etc.)
•	experience with data mining, data analytics and visualization tools.

<b>How to Apply:</b>
